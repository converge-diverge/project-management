Hi-

I am writing to update you on the progress of the analysis for the Plant Community Convergence/Divergence with Global Change working group, for which you provided data.

First, we are well into the initial analysis. I will be presenting the results at this year’s ESA meeting in Baltimore on Friday, August 14th at 8:20 am in the OOS “Cross-Scale Perspectives: Integrating Long-Term and High-Frequency Data into Our Understanding of Communities and Ecosystems”. We plan to finalize our results and start writing up the manuscript this fall. I’ll be in touch with you all as we move forward in this process.

Second, we would like to take advantage of the opportunity provided by this year’s LTER All Scientists Meeting at the end of August to start thinking about future directions for the great dataset we have amassed. We are proposing a “brainstorming” session for ASM where we will provide a brief overview of the analysis currently underway, and then spend most of our time coming up with new ideas for how we can look at the data. To be clear, none of the data will be brought to this meeting and your data will not be given to anyone without your explicit consent. If any ideas from this ASM working group come to fruition as future opt-in analyses, then we will contact you about each opt-in analysis individually to obtain your consent for the use of your data. For now, we’d like to invite you to join our brainstorming working group at ASM, if you’ll be at the meeting.

Third, we have created a data management platform where each dataset user will be able to consent to the use of their data for each new opt-in analysis. We will be sending out the first emails about opt-in analyses using this system in the next couple months.

Finally, one of the organizers of our working group, Meghan Avolio, recently got a postdoc at SESYNC to work on data syntheses emerging from our working group for the next two years. Part of this postdoc will involve management of the data, and she will be contacting you about managing the database in the next couple months as well.

If you have any questions on these points, please feel free to let us know. We are excited about where our first analysis is heading and hope to be in touch with results in the near future!

Thanks again for your participation in this project.

Sincerely,

Kim La Pierre and Meghan Avolio
